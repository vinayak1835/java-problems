Peter asked his friend Max to implement a Java program in which 3 integers X, Y and N are given as a runtime input and all the numbers between X and Y which are divisible by N must be displayed on console. If no such number is possible for the given input then, print NO OUTPUT.

Input Format

3 space separated integers X, Y and N

Constraints

X, Y and N are less than 1000

X and Y are positive integers and X < Y

Output Format

All the integers between X and Y separated by space which are divisible by N

Sample Input 0

6 11 3
Sample Output 0

6 9
Sample Input 1

2 6 2
Sample Output 1

2 4 6


  import java.util.Scanner;

public class DivisibleNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        int sam=0;

        for (int i = X; i <= Y; i++) {
            if (i % N == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
                sam=1;
            }
        }

        if (sam==0) {
            System.out.println("NO OUTPUT");
        }
    }
}
